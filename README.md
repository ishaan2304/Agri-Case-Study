# Agri-Case-Study
This Jupyter Notebook contains the analysis of agricultural production data. The main focus of the analysis is to calculate the mean production for each crop in each season and visualize the results using horizontal bar charts. The visualizations are created using Seaborn, a powerful data visualization library in Python.
